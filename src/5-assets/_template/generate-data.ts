/**
 * @description This script takes the datamined JSON of <DATA_TYPE> and transforms it.
 * @private This script is run automatically as part of the build process. Do not import it into the app.
 *
 * Goals:
 * 1) Validate the structure of the datamined JSON to ensure it matches our expectations and catch any changes early.
 * 2) Make the structure much more convenient to work with in the app by pre-computing the values we care about.
 * 3) Cut down on the amount of data so that the page doesn't bog down when parsing and rendering.
 * 4) Extract key types directly from the generated JSON so that we can have type safety in the rest of the app.
 *
 * Note:
 * This script is intended to be run as a Vite build plugin. Importing any app code into this file
 * is sketchy since Vite has not fully started up yet.
